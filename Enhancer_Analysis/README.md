# This folder is for finding CAGE enhancers and annotating them
* We used human hg38 as a reference. See the file Download_Annotation_File.txt for parameters used for downloading the reference 
* The downloaded reference was then formated using the script Prepare_Annotation_File.R 
* For QC at promoter level, we used CAGEr to find promoters, count their reads, annotate them and compare these results among samples
